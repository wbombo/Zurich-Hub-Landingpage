    "description": "During last year's 2023 Züri schenkt edition we were able to deliver ~1600 gifts to asylum seekers in Zurich, thereof almost half were children or teenagers. This was all possible through a well organized distribution day (and hub event) and a good media coverage. Additionally, we were able to create new partnerships with companies and other organizations in Zurich (e.g. the Refomierte Kirche) and expand our network and supporters.",
